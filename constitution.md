# CONSTITUTION OF THE CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY CONSERVATIVE ASSOCIATION

## 1. — THE ASSOCIATION

The Association shall be known as the Cambridge University Conservative Association. The Association is also known by its initials, CUCA. Throughout this document, references to “CUCA” or “The Association” refer to the Cambridge University Conservative Association.

### 1.1 Objects of the Association

The objects of the Association shall be to promote knowledge, discussion and support of conservative policy, practice, and philosophy both within the university and outside and to provide active assistance for the conservative cause.

While the Association supports the Conservative Party and conservative causes, it is not a part of the Conservative Party or the Young Conservatives.

### 1.2 Notes on Interpretation

These rules constitute the governing contract of an unincorporated Association of the members of the Association. As such, these rules are interpreted under the rules of interpretation appropriate to contracts.

When any intervals in time are mentioned in these rules they are to be interpreted as indicating the length of time that must elapse and not the number of whole Calendar periods that must elapse, unless there is explicit indication to the contrary.

Any standing orders or other rules, orders or instructions derived from these rules or implemented under these rules are interpreted according to the same rules as would apply if they were part of the rules of the Association. The version of the Constitution at the moment whenever a constitutional amendment passes is to be considered the definitive version of the Constitution. The version on GitHub and linked from the website should be updated as soon as reasonably practicable. It is the duty of the Secretary to update it after every TGM to ensure its position as an up-to-date, legitimate document.

### 1.3 Alteration of the Constitution

The Constitution of the Association, with the exception of this paragraph, may be amended by a two-thirds majority vote of a General Meeting of the Association, so long as the nature of the constitutional amendment was set out in the notification of the General Meeting.

No amendment to this Constitution intended to remove the position of the Senior Treasurer; to alter its prerogatives and duties or to change the criteria and procedure for the appointment of a Senior Treasurer can be put to a vote without the prior written agreement of the Junior Proctor of the University of Cambridge

All amendments to the Constitution should be made using GitHub or another auditing method to preserve the transparency of changes to the Constitution and preserve its status as a legitimate, trustworthy document. 

### 1.4 Dissolution of the Association

A General Meeting of the Association may vote to wind up the Association by a two-thirds majority vote. Where the membership of the Association has declined so that the necessary quota is not possible, a simple two-thirds vote of the membership will suffice. The residual assets of the Association on dissolution are to be utilised so as to support of the objects of the Association as far as is possible.

## 2. — MEMBERSHIP OF THE ASSOCIATION

### 2.1 Liability of Members for the Association’s Debts

Members of the Association, unless members of the Committee or having equivalent or greater control over the Association’s activities or liabilities than members of the Committee, or unless subject to another arrangement, are limited in their liability to the debts of the Association to only the subscription they have paid.

The ability of the Association or its members to recover assets held improperly from the Association by a member is not restricted by this section. The liability of all or any members for the Association’s debts is not to reduce or limit any other guarantee of the Association’s debts by members or non-members of the Association.

### 2.2 Ordinary Membership

Ordinary membership of the Association shall be open to individuals who are members of the University. Associate membership of the Association shall be open to individuals who are members of its associated theological and teaching colleges, and students of other higher education institutions in Cambridge.

Membership is not open to persons who have been expelled from the Association.

Names of new members must be lodged separately with the Secretary and the Treasurer as soon as the proper subscription has been paid. Once this has been done, they may only be expelled from the Association by the procedure described in these rules.

The Committee may decide to refuse membership to particular individuals if they believe that the individual is likely to bring the Association into disrepute by their being a member of the Association. This requires a twothirds majority vote. Appeal against such a decision may be made to the Senior Treasurer whose decision is final in such matters. Applicants so refused membership must be informed of this right to appeal.

Ordinary Members shall pay a subscription whose amount shall be determined by the Committee. Any changes to the level of subscription do not take effect until announced at a Termly General Meeting of the Association, or until a General Meeting of the Association to that effect passes a motion.

No one person may pay more than one person’s subscription fee. Individuals wishing to make a donation to the Association’s activities may do so as an explicit donation.

Annual Members of the Association, as of the 25th of June 2023, whose Annual Membership has not expired, shall have their Annual Memberships expire at one year after the original date of purchase. The Association shall not sell Annual Memberships.

An individual may have their membership of the Association revoked or suspended on grounds of misconduct. In order to revoke or suspend a membership, the Committee must vote by a simple majority to do so. Any individual (irrespective of whether they are a member or not) may also be prohibited via the above procedure from attending the Association’s events.

### 2.3 Associate Membership

The Committee may admit Associate members of the Association, either as individuals or according to the membership of other Conservative groups. This is to be decided by a majority vote of Committee. Individual Associate members shall be liable for the same subscription fee as is due from Ordinary members of the Association.

Groups invited to become Associate members will not be so described by the Association until they have indicated that they wish to take up the membership.

The Committee may decide to limit the rights of Associate members described in these rules as they see fit.

The list of individuals and groups who are to be Associate members of the Association from the introduction of this constitution is contained in Schedule I.

### 2.4 Honorary and Senior Officers

The Association shall have Honorary Officers comprising a President, any number of Patrons and up to 20 Vice-Presidents. These offices must only be held by people of distinction who are supporters of the Conservative cause. Patrons should have contributed significantly to the operation of the Association or be expected to do so in the future.

An invitation to become an Honorary Officer of the Association may be extended by a simple majority vote of committee. The invitation is valid for a period of six months. The Honorary Officer takes office if they respond positively to the invitation within six months. Invitations once extended may not be withdrawn.

An Honorary Officer may be removed by a two thirds majority vote of General Meeting. The Senior Officer of the Association is the Senior Treasurer. The Senior Treasurer must be a member of the Regent House, or another resident Senior member of the University approved by the Junior Proctor of the University of Cambridge.

The Senior Treasurer shall be appointed by a simple majority of a General Meeting and shall hold office subject to reappointment in the Termly General Meeting of the subsequent Lent Term.

### 2.5 Voting Members

Only paid-up Ordinary Members of the Association who are in statu pupillari at the University of Cambridge with the sole exception of the Senior Treasurer of the Association are entitled to vote in elections and General Meetings of the Association.

Such members may only, with the sole exception of the Senior Treasurer of the Association, vote if they have attended a meeting of any kind during that Committee session, excluding the particular General Meeting itself. These members are known as Voting Members.

### 2.6 Resignation of Membership

Members will be deemed to have resigned only when they do so in writing to the Chairman of the Association, or a second annual subscription for that member is not paid. Once a member has resigned, they will have to pay a new subscription if they wish to re-join and any payments prior to their resignation are not to count towards their life membership fee.

## 3. —OF THE COMMITTEE

### 3.1 The Committee

The Committee of the Association shall consist of its Executive and Non-Executive Officers. The Executive Officers are the Chairman, Vice Chairman, Treasurer, Campaigns Officer, Speakers and Externals Officer, Communications and Publicity Officer, Secretary, Social Events Officer, Speakers and Externals Officer-Elect.

The non-executive officers are up to ten appointed members and the two Alumni Officers. The Elected Members are appointed according to the rules laid out in Chapter 5. The Treasurer and appointed members shall be reappointed according to the standard rules for their appointment. The two Alumni Officers shall be appointed in the same manner as the Treasurer. For the avoidance of confusion, the Alumni Officers are not executive officers and shall not comprise a part of any Committee quorum.

The Treasurer and appointed members shall be re-appointed according to the standard rules for their appointment.

The Chairman receives nominations for appointed members and these nominations are subject to approval by the newly elected Committee at their first meeting.

A Committee meeting shall be quorate with the attendance of at least half its voting members, including the Chairman of the Association.

The Committee may allow the admittance of Observers to their meetings, through a majority vote. Any former Chairman in statu pupillari shall automatically be invited to meetings of the Committee as an Observer.

### 3.2 Decisions of Committee

Each voting member of the Committee has a single vote. Voting rights are non-transferrable. The voting members of the Committee are the Executive Officers. Unless otherwise stated within this constitution, decisions of the Committee are decided by a simple majority vote on a single item, at a properly convened meeting of the group concerned. Decisions are taken by a show of hands unless otherwise indicated by this constitution or so wished by a decision of the Committee. In case of an equally divided vote, the casting vote lies with the person chairing the meeting.

The quorum for the Committee shall be the presence of at least half of its voting members

### 3.3 The Powers and Duties of the Committee

The Committee takes decisions concerning the day-to-day running of the Association, taking due regard of any decisions taken by the General Meetings of the Association and the objects of the Association.

The Committee is responsible for the ratification of candidates whom the Campaigns Officer has proposed as standing for elections outside the Association with the support of the Association. The Association cannot support particular candidates for its own internal elections.

Not more than 14 Full Term days may elapse between meetings of the Committee. A Committee may be summoned by the Chairman or by the request of majority of the members of the Committee.

Should any member of the Committee fail to attend two meetings, the Secretary must inform them at least 72 hours in advance of the next meeting, and should they fail to attend the third consecutive meeting without a bona fide reason, they will be deemed to have resigned from their post and the process designated under 3.4 will be initiated. A member of Committee will also be deemed to have failed to attend a meeting if they do not stay for at least 10 minutes, or if the meeting ceased to be quorate because of their departure during it. This rule shall not apply to meetings of less than ten minutes duration which were closed by unanimous and quorate consent of those present. When a member of the Committee is unable to fulfil their duties, they are to be managed ad-hoc by other members of the Committee until a replacement can be found in accordance with the rules set out for their election or appointment, in line with 3.4 below.

The Committee has the power to create sub-committees which shall be chaired by the relevant Executive or Non-Executive Officer. The Committee shall by simple majority exercise the power to create sub-committees and deem which Officer is the relevant Chairman of the Sub-Committee. The Chairman of the Association shall sit on all of these committees by default (except the initially existing subcommittees, though they may be appointed) and possess the power to summon all of them. The Chairman of the Sub-Committee shall also possess the power to summon their subcommittee. The Chairman of the Association is not precluded from serving as Chairman of any sub-committee. The relevant officer is to decide upon the composition of sub-committees and to create all other rules for their operation and membership. A sub- committee need not contain solely those who are members of the Committee. A sub-committee may only take action in areas designated upon its creation and under no circumstances may incur expenses that have not been approved by the Committee. The members of a sub- committee are personally liable for any expenses incurred without proper authority. The sub- committees of the Association that exist initially when this Constitution comes into force are listed in Schedule III below.

All executive Committee members, as well as both Alumni officers, leaving office must arrange a handover meeting with their successor. This shall not apply to appointed members. Handover meetings shall involve a discussion of the powers and duties of each respective role. If a meeting cannot be arranged, then the former Officer must deposit a handover document detailing important information regarding their role with the incoming Chairman. If an outgoing Officer fails to organise a handover meeting or deposit a handover document with the incoming Chairman within two weeks of leaving office, then that former Officer shall be deemed to have resigned their membership of the Association.

### 3.4 Resignation of Committee members

A Committee member will be deemed to have resigned from their position on the Committee only when they do so in writing to the Chairman of the Association. Committee resignation does not resign ordinary membership.

In the case of Committee resignation, the duties of the resigning member must be met. All duties and powers of the vacant position may be exercised by the Committee ad-hoc in accordance with the spirit set out in 3.3 for officers unable to fulfil their duties. The Committee shall exercise these powers by majority vote, or by temporarily vesting particular duties and powers in officers whom the Committee shall choose by simple majority. The manner of replacement lies at the discretion of the Committee by a motion carried with a simple majority vote, apart from in the case where the Chairmanship is vacant. In the latter case the manner of replacement will be at the discretion of the Vice-Chairman.

Nobody may hold more than one Officer position at any time. They must resign their position before taking up another one.

Someone may only be appointed Chairman or Vice-Chairman if they have served an entire Full Term as an Executive Officer or obtain the permission (by simple majority vote) of Committee in the term they are appointed. This should not be confused with a special, separate matter: the mechanism by which, usually as a penalty, an individual is deemed to have either resigned or offered resignation to Commitee. Where someone is deemed to have resigned their post, the act itself cannot be overridden by Committee. However, a different situation arises where the Constitution indicates the resignation is automatically offered to Committee. The Committee shall, in such cases of automatically offered resignation, have the power to reject the automatic offer of resignation by a motion passed with a simple majority vote. Such a vote is not necessary as the matter can simply not be brought up, however if resignation is rejected then the condition which triggered the situation will be treated in constitutional terms as if it had not happened. Where an officer has been deemed to resign, as opposed to having been deemed to their resignation, the post falls vacant. Unless forbidden by this constitution, the former holder of the post may be reappointed using existing powers like any eligible Member.

### 3.5 The Powers and Duties of the Senior Treasurer

The Senior Treasurer shall:

(i) supervise the running of the Association.
(ii) supervise the recording and auditing of the accounts; have ultimate control over the Association accounts; determine election disciplines; and (v) exercise disciplinary authority over members of the Committee.

In connection with these duties, the power of the
Senior Treasurer shall include:

(i) disqualification from candidature for, or election to, or from the holding of, any office, position, or other place within the Association.
(ii) suspension from, or deprivation of, membership of the Association; and
(iii) nullifying any decision made by any other person or body, except a two thirds majority of a General meeting within the Association which has, or purports to have, the effect of disqualification or suspension or deprivation as aforesaid; provided always that the Senior Treasurer shall not suspend from or deprive of membership of the Association any person whom they are satisfied acted in good faith.

Any member affected by any ruling given by the Senior Treasurer may appeal to a General Meeting, a quorate two-thirds majority vote of which shall overturn that ruling. The Senior Treasurer shall not be liable for any financial debt or other obligation of the Association unless they have personally authorised such a debt in writing.

### 3.5 The Powers and Duties of the Chairman

The Chairman is responsible for the activities of the Association for the period of their term in office. The Chairman is responsible for the running of the Association in between the meetings of the Committee, and with due regard of the decisions of the General Meeting and the Objects of the Association. The Chairman is also responsible for all press engagement on behalf of the Association.

The Chairman is also responsible for ensuring the Campaigns Officer organises a term of sufficient campaigns, policy discussions and social action, and for ensuring the Treasurer provides the Committee with adequate and accurate guidance as to the financial means of the Association and keeps full and clear accounts. 

In particular, the Chairman is responsible for organising a successful series of ordinary meetings during their period of office.

### 3.6 The Powers and Duties of the Vice-Chairman

The Vice-Chairman shall take over the role of the Chairman for the term following their election, or at their discretion if they chose to in the event of the resignation or removal of the Chairman from office.

They are also responsible for the preparation of the programme of the Association for the term of their Chairmanship. The Chairman may delegate relevant powers or duties to the Vice-Chairman in the former’s absence.

### 3.7 The Powers and Duties of the Treasurer

The Treasurer shall, under the supervision of the
Senior Treasurer, be responsible for the financial affairs of the Association. The Treasurer shall keep adequate and up-to-date records of the accounts of the Association. Failure to do so shall result in the Treasurer being deemed to have offered to the Committee their resignation from office, in accordance with the judgement of Committee.

The Treasurer shall submit a full and up to date set of accounts to the Committee once every month. Failure to do so shall result in the Treasurer being deemed to have offered to the Committee their resignation from office. The Treasurer shall present a full and up-to-date set of accounts at the Termly General Meeting in Easter term at the end of their period of office, and shall submit these accounts to the Junior Proctor, and shall send copies to the Senior Treasurer within three days of the meeting.

The Treasurer shall also be responsible for ensuring their successor is adequately aware of and familiar with the role and its requirements.

#### 3.7.1 Responsibility for Expenditure, Deficits and Savings

No expenditure below a limit fixed by a General Meeting of the Association and initially set out in Schedule II below may be incurred by the Association without the prior and explicit approval of the Treasurer. No expenditure above a limit, fixed by a General Meeting of the Association and initially set at the level given in Schedule II below, may be incurred without the specific approval of the Chairman. Committee may override the decision of the Chairman, and thus approve or reject the expenditure, by majority vote.

The Association may, by approval of the Treasurer, undertake Operational debt whereby the Association is obligated to reimburse members of Committee who spend personal finance for the approved benefit of the Association. Reimbursement must occur within 7 days of payment. If it does not occur, the person or body wishing to be reimbursed may send a notification in writing to the Treasurer and the Chairman via their university e-mail addresses. If a further 7 days without reimbursement should elapse after the Treasurer and Chairman receive this notification, the Treasurer will be deemed to have resigned their post and the Chairman offered their resignation to Committee. This rule will not apply to any reimbursement which the Treasury Committee has deemed manifestly unfounded or excessive, however such a decision about a reimbursement may be overruled by two-thirds of Committee. This rule also only functions provided that no reimbursement which is vexatious, fraudulent, or with a criminal purpose shall fall within its scope. The intentional payment of vexatious, fraudulent, or criminally-intended funds will constitute the immediate resignation of the Treasurer and leave the ex-Treasurer owing the same sum to the Association as a debt. The ex-Treasurer may not hold any Committee post in future in this case. The forgiving of this debt for a vexatious, fraudulent, or criminal purpose will constitute the same for any officer responsible. For debts of above the Schedule II limit, the usual rules on approval of expenditure also apply.

If a debt is proposed which is not to be repaid fully within that Committee session, it is to be considered Successive debt. Successive debt requires unanimous approval by Committee.

Expenditure incurred outside the scope of these rules is not the responsibility of the Association. The individual who incurred the expenditure is wholly responsible for it.

No deficit may be incurred without explicit approval from the Committee. A deficit is incurred when the Association's expenditure exceeds its revenue across any period of two consecutive calendar months without approval from the committee. For this purpose, monies owed to the Association may not be included in revenue, while debts incurred by the Association must be included as expenditure, although the purchasing of assets need not be included as expenditure. If the Association goes into deficit without the explicit approval of the Committee, then a vote of confidence in the Treasurer must be held at the next committee meeting, requiring a simple majority vote of the Committee. In the event of a loss of confidence, the Treasurer shall be dismissed and a new one appointed according to the standard rules for their appointment and hold office until the Termly General Meeting in Easter Term.

### 3.8 Association Savings

The Treasurer is required to allocate no less than £1000 to a savings account separate from the current account of the Association. These savings are not to be used for general expenditure and may only be accessed upon the exhaustion of current account funds, with the assent of a two-thirds majority of Committee and the written consent of the Senior Treasurer.

If the savings account is accessed without the required permissions the Treasurer and Chairman will be deemed to have offered their resignations to Committee, effective immediately. 

The interest accrued from the savings account may be allocated at the discretion of the Treasurer.

### 3.9 The Powers and Duties of the Campaigns Officer

The Campaigns Officer shall have a responsibility and duty to organise campaigns, meetings, policy discussion meetings, social action meetings and related events, which promote any cause of the Conservative and Unionist Party or the cause of conservatism within the wider university.

Additionally, they shall have responsibility for the running of campaigns for the election of Conservative candidates within and outside the University, approved as per 3.3. The Campaigns officer shall keep accurate and fair records of attendance at Campaigns meetings.

The Campaigns Officer shall also be responsible for ensuring that their successor is adequately aware of and familiar with the role and its requirements.

### 3.10 The Powers and Duties of the Communications and Publicity Officer

All online and offline media shall be approved by the Chairman prior to circulation. In cases of irreconcilable disagreement, the Chairman may call a Committee vote.

### 3.11 The Powers and Duties of the Speakers and Externals Officer

The Speakers and Externals Officer-Elect shall automatically take the role of Speakers and External officer upon the conclusion of their term. The Speakers and Externals Officer shall be responsible for inviting and securing individuals external to the Association to visit in order to address the Association and its membership.

A vote of censure shall only pass if two-thirds of the Committee approve it. If a Committee member is successfully censured, they will be removed from office immediately.
